# My Personal Website

Thank you to freecodecamp.org for the tutorial on how to complete a website. I had now idea where to start and so I decided to follow a video to assist with what to add and where to begin.

I believe that I have learned a lot from coding along with an experienced web developer as I have struggled mostly with the JavaScript portion of the prework.
